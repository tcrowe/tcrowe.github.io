  <h1>Code Communists</h1>
  <p>I’ve had an interest in Communist ideology for some time. After I <a href="https://github.com/tcrowe/nodejs-communist-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncovered that nodejs had a Communist problem</a> I decided to see where else the evidence pointed. Did Communist ideology really permeate the industry as some people claimed?</p>
<p>This month I created a new larger investigation called <a href="https://github.com/tcrowe/code-communists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Communists</a> which goes over some of the ideology generally and then organizations like Microsoft, Google, GitHub, and Netlify more specifically. It has been an illuminating experience for me and I hope you get something out of it too.</p>
