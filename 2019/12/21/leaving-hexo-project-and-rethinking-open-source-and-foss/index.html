  <h1>Leaving Hexo Project and Rethinking Open Source and FOSS</h1>
  <p>After being a contributor for some time and then taking a break I stumbled onto this issue about how Hexo organization was creating a C.o.C., a Code of Conduct, and so I decided to chime in and tell them the origin of the idea and the politics involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/pull/3962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/pull/3962</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tcrowe/code-communists/blob/master/projects/hexo/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/tcrowe/code-communists/blob/master/projects/hexo/index.md</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you get familiar with the Liberal politics involved and how some people just go along with it you can see a part of an evolving dynamic in the open source or FOSS community. There is another aspect to it which illuminated, for me at least, the complete disregard there really is for other people in the team. A part of me did know but it became more clear with this experience.</p>
<p>Some questions came up in my mind when going through the information and their responses, or lack of response.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the common ground we have that allows us to create the projects?</li>
<li>Is there any explicit or implicit ethnic solidarity between some of the contributors?</li>
<li>If people have no honor and will not defend a team member from abuse, why is that?</li>
<li>What can we do to intentionally build code together but with assurances we will have political and social solidarity with one another?</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no easy answer to that and even if you presented some answers it would be controversial at this time in history. When I asked the question “Is there any explicit or implicit ethnic solidarity between some of the contributors?” it was in response to my article about Hexo and how they have a large Han Chinese ethnic majority in the project. I believe it’s an important aspect to the issue but it needs more looking into. Not about the Chinese but the question about team ethnic composition.</p>
<p>The experience with Linus Torvalds and The Linux Foundation has shown us a similar thing that there is a risk for having diversity on these projects. I’m sure this will become much more clear over time. Personally I want to be on the forefront of the development of the ideas in that space and see where it goes.</p>
