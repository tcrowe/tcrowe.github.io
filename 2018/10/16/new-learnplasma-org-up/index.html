  <h1>New LearnPlasma.org Up!</h1>
  <p>We did a bunch of work to refactor the site for <a href="https://www.learnplasma.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LearnPlasma.org</a>. The goal was to make it an all around better experience to write, maintain, and accept community contributions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.learnplasma.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="/img/contributions/ethsociety-learn-plasma.png" alt="learn plasma site screen shot"></a></p>
<p>We accomplished this by switching to a static site generator. This solved our problem of having duplicated files. <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a> gives us templating and markdown support.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar, Plasma is an idea gaining traction in the Ethereum community as a way to address scalability concerns. We’re looking forward to seeing if there are some gains to be made with speed and security. Plasma will give ways for users to move their money off and on Ethereum and provide cryptographic techniques to ensure their safety.</p>
